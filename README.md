## 🩺 Clinical problem

In neonatal ICUs, daily fluid balance is critical for patient safety.  
Small calculation errors can lead to serious complications like **hypovolemia**, **hypervolemia**, or **hemodynamic instability**.

During my shifts, I noticed the workflow was:
- Manual (paper or spreadsheets)
- Error-prone under stress
- Repetitive and time-consuming

## 💡 My solution

This web-based calculator automates the fluid balance process, reducing risks and saving time.

Designed to be simple and effective for ICU staff — whether used on computers, tablets, or phones.
